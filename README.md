  <h1 align="center">Use pytube instead lol.<br/><br/>Why would you waste your time recreating a library that is already existed and is a lot better than yours...<br/><br/>Pathetic...<br/><br/>This library is officially dead.<br/><br/>If only pytube could make a better looking documentation...<br/><br/>So yeah pytube. I don't want to waste my time maintaining the scraper anymore.<br/><br/>I don't have contributors for this library, while pytube has tons of them. I don't have these much time to keep this scraper alive without any bugs.</h1>
